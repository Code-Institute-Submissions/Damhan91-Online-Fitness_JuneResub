<h1 class = "heading">Excercises</h1>
<p class="intro">This section is to show you what exercises you should be doing on what day. The idea of splitting up of body parts is to allow enough recovery for each body part before returning to work on them again. if you find you are still too sore, consider stretching and using a massage roller to help those sore muscles.</p>
