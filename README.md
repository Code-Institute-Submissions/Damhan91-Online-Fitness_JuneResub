## Introduction
The idea for this project was based around fitness industry and personnel training, which is something that I enjoy. With most jobs now being able to work remotely, personal trainers shouldn't be restricted to people in their local area. Having this website will allow a personal trainer to guide and train their clients on diet and exercises and share fitness blogs, where users can share their thoughts and ideas. To be able to see this content the use must first register and sign up to the website.
