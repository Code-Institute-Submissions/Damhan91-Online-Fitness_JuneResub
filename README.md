## Introduction
The idea for this project was based around fitness industry and personnel training, which is something that I enjoy. With most jobs now being able to work remotely, personal trainers shouldn't be restricted to people in their local area. Having this website will allow a personal trainer to guide and train their clients on diet and exercises that are not from their local area. The website also shares fitness blogs, where users can share their thoughts and ideas on each blog. To be able to see this content the use must first register and sign up to the website. For the user, it can be very over whelming for new people getting into fitness. This website condenses that information into easily read and easy to understand instructions to help the user achieve their goals.

The user experience I wanted the user to be able to look and find the information as quickly as possible. The website is easy and straight forward to register and sign up to and I wanted the main content of the website to only accessible to registered users.

## Design
For the design of the website, I went with three main colours. Black and grey with white writing. I wanted the writing and information to be the thing that captures the users attention and not getting distracted by an array of different colours. The white writing looks best against the dark background and really stands out.

Images
For images I used them where i felt it they were needed and added to the aesthetic of the website. I initially had a large banner image covering the top half of the webpage, but I removed this as I felt it gave a bad user experience because each time you would have to scroll down to view the content
